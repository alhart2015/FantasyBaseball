"""Roto scoring and team stat projection — shared across all modules.

Provides core functions:
- project_team_stats: sum projected stats for a roster into a
  CategoryStats. Accepts Player dataclass objects OR flat dicts for
  backwards compatibility with draft/script callers that still build
  rosters as plain dicts.
- project_team_sds: analytical team-level standard deviations for
  each category under player-independence, used to price projection
  uncertainty into score_roto.
- score_roto: assign expected roto points via pairwise Gaussian
  win-probabilities. With team_sds=None, collapses to rank-based
  scoring with averaged ties (backwards-compatible default).
